Principles of Lean development
-------------------------------
If you aim at speed, you may get speed, but you'll get waste. If you aim at the elimination of waste, you'll eliminate waste and get speed.

-> Write the test first
-> Nothing is error-free
-> Test first makes the code more testable and makes you focus on what you can know  for sure

The seven Principles
---------------------
Eliminate waste
Build quality in
Create knowledge
Defer commitment
Deliver fast
Improve flow
Optimize the whole system
Empower people or respect people
Focus on customer value
Continuous improvement

Iac - Infrastructure as code
------------------------------

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a foundational practice in modern DevOps that allows for the automation, consistency, and scalability of infrastructure management. 
It eliminates manual intervention, reduces errors, and enables faster, more reliable software delivery by treating infrastructure as software.
By using IaC, teams can provision and manage infrastructure just like they would manage code, ensuring repeatability, versioning, and efficiency in their infrastructure 
management.

In the context of infrastructure provisioning (like in DevOps or IT), the word "சேர்க்கை" or "வழங்கல்" can be used to indicate the act of setting up, supplying, 
or configuring the necessary infrastructure or resources.

Verifying knowledge in Devops
-------------------------------
Creating knowledge
First win is build
Second win is tests
The big win is Automated deployment

Automated unit tests - using test in script - in pipeline it automates tests
Static analysis
Automated deployment
